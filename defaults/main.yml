# taken during prompts, following values for those variables will be used:
#
# domain: foolcontrol.org
# stage: staging
# wp_version: 5.2.3
# wp_db_user: admin
# wp_db_psw: change-M3
# db_root_psw: change-M3
# wp_db_name: wordpress
# wp_db_tb_pre: wp_
# wp_db_host: mysql

# If you want to specify all variables without interactive prompts, can you
# do so by using: --extra-vars
# 
# Please see http://foolcontrol.org/?p=2002 for more details
